## Design and User Interaction

The application's frontend is developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and attractive interface. Supabase storage is used for efficient media handling, while real-time data interactions are managed through Supabaseâ€™s real-time capabilities. The backend functionalities, including user authentication and database interactions, are securely handled by Supabase, providing a robust and scalable solution for the music library system. User interactions such as song uploads, playlist editing, and track favoriting are intuitively designed, making it easy for users to navigate and enjoy their music collection.
